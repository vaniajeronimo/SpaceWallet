# 🚀 Space Wallet

**Space Wallet** is a crypto wallet app developed as a test project, focusing on design, user experience, and simulation of real-world features — entirely built on the **front-end**.

## ✨ About the Project

This project simulates the behavior of a modern cryptocurrency wallet with:

- Fully custom UI designed by a professional designer  
- Polished user experience  
- Mocked services (no real backend)

> 🔒 **Note:** This is **not a real wallet** and should not be used for actual transactions.
